# Abstract
Reversi is a two-player, zero-sum, strategy board game whose complexity lies between that of checkers and chess. Our research seeks to create Reversi-playing agents by using a genetic algorithm to evolve weights of a neural network. Agents rely on their neural network to make their decisions for moves of a game. In this paper we compare different styles of evolution and various settings for the neural network.
